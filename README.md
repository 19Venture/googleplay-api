# Google play python3 API

This project contains an unofficial API for google play interactions. The code mainly comes from
[GooglePlayAPI project](https://github.com/egirault/googleplay-api/) which was written for python2 and it's not
maintained anymore. The code was ported to python3 with some minor additions and updates, mainly for python3 compatibility.
